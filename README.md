# Parkinson-disease-detection
The Main objective of Parkinson's disease detectioniston build a model using Machine learning to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson's disease in an individual

Model Used
1. We have used Support vector machine(SVM) algorithm

2. Svm is supervised learning algorithm that can be used for
   both classification Or regression
 
3.Svm can classify data into two categories by finding the
  best hyperplane that separates the two categories.
  
4.Our dataset contains over 195 entries .
  In our case,SVM classifies the data into two categories
  
6.One is patients have parkinson's disease and another is
  patient is healthy
